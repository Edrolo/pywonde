```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import wonde
```

```python
import wonde
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import time
import wonde
from wonde.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.wonde.com/v1.0
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = wonde.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.wonde.com/v1.0"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: BasicAuth
configuration = wonde.Configuration(
    username = os.environ["USERNAME"],
    password = os.environ["PASSWORD"]
)

# Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = wonde.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with wonde.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = wonde.ClassesApi(api_client)
    school_id = 'school_id_example' # str | The ID of the school
    class_id = 'class_id_example' # str | The ID of the class

    try:
        # Get specific class for a school
        api_response = api_instance.schools_school_id_classes_class_id_get(school_id, class_id)
        print("The response of ClassesApi->schools_school_id_classes_class_id_get:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ClassesApi->schools_school_id_classes_class_id_get: %s\n" % e)

```
